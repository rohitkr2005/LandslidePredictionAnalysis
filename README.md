# LandslidePredictionAnalysis

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of landslides using machine learning models trained on environmental and geological data

üìå Objective

To build a predictive model that can identify landslide-prone areas based on features like rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, and other topographical parameters. The aim is to support early warning systems using data-driven insights.

üß∞ Tools & Technologies
Language: Python

IDE: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas, numpy for data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn for visualization

scikit-learn for machine learning and evaluation

üìä Dataset

The dataset includes historical data with features such as slope, elevation, rainfall, temperature, and vegetation cover. It required cleaning, encoding, and preprocessing before being fed into models.

üîÅ Workflow Summary

Data Loading & Exploration

Loaded the dataset and understood its structure using pandas

Visualized feature distributions and correlations

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values and removed irrelevant features

Applied label encoding where necessary

Feature Selection

Selected important features based on correlation and domain understanding

Train-Test Split

Used train_test_split to divide the data for training and evaluation

Model Building

Trained two classification models:

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Model Evaluation

Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, and recall

Residual Analysis

Visualized residuals to assess model performance

Documentation & Reporting

Compiled a clean, structured notebook with explanations and results
